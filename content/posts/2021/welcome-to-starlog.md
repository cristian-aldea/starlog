Hello!

Welcome to Starlog, my new blog! Here, I'll be writing posts exploring various topics I find interesting. It's meant as a platform so I can share knowledge with others.

Programming and software development will likely be the main focus of this blog, but I'll be discussing anything that I find interesting.

I don't have a release schedule for these posts. I'll be creating them as I find topics to cover, so make sure to stay tuned!

## Source code

[cristian-aldea/starlog](https://github.com/cristian-aldea/starlog) is the git repository containing the source code for this blog.

As of writing, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.
