Hello!

Welcome to Starlog, my new blog! Here, I'll be writing about topics I find interesting or knowledge I want to share.

Programming will be the main focus of this blog, but I might branch out into other categories later on.

I don't have a release schedule for these posts. I'll be creating them as I find topics to cover, so make sure to stay tuned!

## Source code

[cristian-aldea/starlog](https://github.com/cristian-aldea/starlog) is the git repository with the source code for this blog.

As of writing, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, which I might customize as I better understand how Hugo's templating engine works.
