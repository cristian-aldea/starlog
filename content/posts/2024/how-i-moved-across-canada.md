I got the opportunity to move to Vancouver when I started my new position as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Summer 2022. I had been living with family beforehand and had little experience with moving. I learned a lot while going through the process, and I wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone.

## Timing

When planning the relocation, I first had to settle on when I'd move. I was looking for a time that would work best. Generally, the time of year can play a factor:

- ‚òÄÔ∏èSummer can be a busy season for moves and rent might be a bit higher, especially during back to school around August-September
- ‚ùÑÔ∏èWinter isn't very busy, but the weather can be rough depending on where you're moving to

üçÇFall seemed like a good fit, so I planned my travel for Fall 2022.

## Transportation

After picking a date, I had to consider transportation. I chose to fly to Vancouver since I didn't own a car and didn't want to take the train. But it'll depend on your preferences.

Don't forget to take advantage of any relocation benefits you might have with your employer. You might be able to expense the transportation, movers or temporary accommodations you used for your move.

## Residence

After arriving in Vancouver, I booked some short-term accommodations while I went looking for a place to rent, this worked out well for me:

- ‚úÖ I got to experience the city and visit neighbourhoods before picking a place
- ‚úÖ You can avoid scams much more easily by dealing with people in person
- ‚ùå I had to move my stuff twice. I packed lightly so this wasn't a big issue

A few tips related to renting I picked up were:

- Don't ever send payments to someone without first seeing the home and signing a tenancy agreement. Places like Craigslist have a great set of guidelines to help keep you safe: <https://www.craigslist.org/about/scams>.
- When signing a lease agreement, double-check that it's the official form by visiting your local government website. Here's an example for Vancouver, BC: [Link](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenancies/forms)
- Take advantage of any relocation benefits you might have with your employer to help with the financial burden

## Luggage and Stuff

I initially packed just the necessities to help with moving, and then shipped or brought over things over time as I settled into the new place I was renting long-term.

## Updating all your services

Once I had a new address, I had to update my home address to a bunch of services:

- üè¢ my employer
- üçÅthe government (provincial and federal)
- üè¶banks
- and other online services I use

I also had to book some appointments to get ID and documentation as a BC resident. If you're moving somewhere you'll likely be able to find resources on the matter, such as [Moving to British Columbia from within Canada](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/tourism-immigration/moving-bc-a).

## Adjusting to the new City

My first weeks in Vancouver were busy and exciting. A few months in, after I settled into a routine, I was happy to have the time to explore the city, but at the same time, I felt a bit off being far away from home.

When I started feeling homesick, I'd stay in touch with friends and family online, and explore what Vancouver had to offer: hikes, running, and much more!
