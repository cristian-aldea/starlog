Hello!

Welcome to Starlog, my new blog. Here, I'll be documenting things I want to share with the world, either because I found it interesting, or because it might have educational value to someone.

I don't have a release schedule for these posts. I'll be creating posts as I find topics to cover, so make sure to stay tuned!

## Source code

[cristian-aldea/starlog](https://github.com/cristian-aldea/starlog) is the git repository with the source code for this blog.

As of writing, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.
