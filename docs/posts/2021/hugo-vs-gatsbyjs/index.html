While researching, I found many popular options listed on websites like jamstack.org, and narrowed down my choices to GatsbyJS or Hugo.\nI ended up going with Hugo for now, and this post will explain why. If you’re also looking to start a blog, use the information below to inform your decision, and pick whatever is the best fit for you.\nFaster Build Times First, my biggest issue with Gatsby was the build times. Builds with Hugo are much faster than with Gatsby, which helps with the development experience.\nBuild Time Comparison To be precise, I did some benchmarks of the build times between Hugo and Gatsby (taken from the logs), and summarized everything in the table below. I compared the following projects:\nStarlog: created with Hugo, with two posts and a theme Blank Gatsby: a Gatsby project created using npm init gatsby, with no posts Gatsby blog starter: a Gatsby project using the official Gatsby blog starter, with no posts Metric Starlog Blank Gatsby Gatsby blog starter Initial development build 0.037s 13.156s 14.622s Rebuild on code change 0.008s 0.197s 0.293s Production build 0.061s 23.967s 31.349s The difference is substantial. With Hugo, the builds felt instantaneous, while with Gatsby, the builds felt much slower.\nHowever, the biggest pain point was Gatsby’s rebuilds on code changes. Despite what the logs say, it felt like it took a second or two for me to see the changes in the browser after making changes in Gatsby.\nKeep in mind that the Gatsby build times were for projects with no posts. As you add plugins and posts the build time can get much longer.\nWhy is Hugo faster? There are two main reasons why Hugo’s builds are considerably faster:\nGolang vs JavaScript (JS) Hugo is implemented in Golang and compiled into a binary Gatsby is implemented in JavaScript. JavaScript isn’t compiled1 and is dynamically typed, which typically leads to slower code Templating vs React Hugo uses Golang templating, which uses simple rules and constructs, and is processed very quickly Gatsby runs the React library to generate the DOM tree for every page and then renders each tree into static HTML, which is a much more complicated and lengthy process Overkill This is something I will explore in more detail in a future post. For now, you need to understand that each tool has its use.\nGatsby is a clever framework with a lot of cool features:\nit uses React, which makes it easy to develop dynamic applications through declarative code it pre-renders your pages, to improve performance and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) it “hydrates” your pages, keeping them dynamic as if it was a regular React app It blends the best of both worlds, keeping the performance of a static website, while allowing for the dynamic rendering of a single-page application.\nHowever, my blog will be serving mostly static content, and wouldn’t benefit much from the strengths of React or Gatsby. It would however be much slower and bloated than it needs to be.\nnpm Bloat Using Gatsby and npm leads to a lot of bloat. From my experience, npm projects are hard to maintain. You rely on countless packages maintained by thousands of contributors. When you revisit an npm project after a while, you’ll often find that your dependencies are outdated or abandoned, and updating them can lead to a lot of frustration, especially if the project was abandoned.\nnpm has matured a lot, but is still very volatile. I wanted to minimize how many dependencies I had for this simple project. With Hugo, all I needed was the Hugo CLI and a theme, which just requires me to copy some files around.\nA lot of JavaScript Gatsby applications need a lot of JavaScript to work, since React relies on a client-side JavaScript runtime to keep the pages dynamic.\nThe table below outlines the HTML and JS content for each of the projects listed earlier, using the following command:\n# for html find public/ -type f -name '*.html' -exec du -ch -B KB {} + # for js find public/ -type f -name '*.js' -exec du -ch -B KB {} + Metric Starlog Blank Gatsby Gatsby blog starter HTML Content 152kB 17kB 201kB JS Content 123kB 283kB 345kB Total Website Size 459kB 1139kB 3597kB Hugo mostly outputs HTML code. The JavaScript code is from the code block highlighting support, and can easily be removed.\nAlthough JavaScript is very powerful and flexible, it’s also the most expensive thing to ship to the browser. Every byte of JavaScript you send to a browser takes much more time and energy to process than HTML or CSS, which are simple to parse and execute.\nIf you don’t need your app to be very dynamic, then you don’t need a lot of JavaScript. This will lead to your websites being slimmer and faster than they possibly could be with a framework like React or Angular.\nThe Vanilla JavaScript Podcast has a lot of nice episodes explaining the issue I’ve described with JavaScript if you want to learn more.\nA few episodes I liked:\nhttps://vanillajspodcast.com/the-developer-experience-is-bullshit https://vanillajspodcast.com/how-i-structure-my-vanilla-js-projects (My projects used to be based on this template! It’s very good) https://vanillajspodcast.com/the-web-is-getting-slower Simplicity I was already very familiar with JavaScript, npm, and React when I decided to create Starlog. Gatsby would have been a good fit considering my skills. Hugo, on the other hand, has a templating engine that I didn’t know very well.\nDespite this, I found that learning Hugo was easier for me than learning Gatsby, due to how much more complicated the Gatsby ecosystem is, with the seemingly endless choices it offers in terms of plugins and configuration.\nSelf-congratulating While researching the pros and cons of Hugo and Gatsby, something that annoyed me was an article from Gatsby comparing JAMstack technologies.\nThe review article has an obvious conflict of interest, since it’s published and controlled by Gatsby. Also, the article wasn’t very useful to me because:\nthey compare the products on very generic criteria, without explaining how they reached the scores they got they list very few losing comparisons for Gatsby, making it seem like the perfect solution in all situations (which isn’t the case) they claim that Hugo has poor “Modern JavaScript syntax” support, which is strange. Hugo has long supported ESBuild, which allows you to bundle and transpile your JavaScript code to keep it compatible with older browsers they list redundant points, such as having excellent “Componentization”, “Component libraries” and “Component ecosystem”. Well organizing your code and using templates, you can also achieve good reuse of code through Hugo, so this isn’t very useful. they add “Swag store” as one of the upsides of Gatsby. Why is this here? I thought we were comparing frameworks here! 🤣 This doesn’t affect my appreciation of Gatsby as a project, but it did put a dent in my impression of the company.\nConclusion Although Gatsby is a great project, I didn’t think it was a good fit for me. I wasn’t going to leverage its strengths, and its downsides were too annoying to me.\nIf you feel like the downsides I listed wouldn’t be a deal-breaker for you, feel free to pick up Gatsby, I had a lot of fun while trying it out.\nFor now, I’ll be using Hugo. But that might very well change in the future.\nReferences https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/ JavasScript runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine. It’s not strictly “interpreted”, since the engine does a lot of clever tricks to speed up JavaScript execution (although it’s still slower than a compiled, statically-typed language like Go).
